The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise
To see you very much alive in the English rain again

And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy?
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child

I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers

And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy?
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child

Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon
