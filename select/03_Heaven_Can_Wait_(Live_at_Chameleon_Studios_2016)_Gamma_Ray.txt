Too many people, too much trouble
Too many problems in the morn
Another sunrise in the rubble
Another ship sunk by the storm

Some little angel tries to tell me that it's over
It's just a bad reflection from above
The load upon my shoulder
Makes me stronger, even bolder
Oh, no, no, I haven't had enough

Heaven can wait till another day
'Cause there ain't no reason to leave
The world is a stage where we all can play
Another fine reason to live
And heaven can wait, heaven can wait

Each day a new reason to give up
Each day another reason to sigh
A hundred thousand ways to live up
A hundred thousand ways to try

Hey little angel, don't you tell me that it's over
You're just a bad reflection from above
The load upon my shoulder
Gives me reasons to get older
Tell the boss I haven't had enough, oh

Heaven can wait till another day
'Cause there ain't no reason to leave
The world is a stage where we all can play
Another fine reason to live
And heaven can wait, heaven can wait
Let it wait, let it wait, let it wait, let it wait

Our eyes are closed, but they should be open wide
Let's listen to the voice, that's calling from inside
Let's stay alive and move on, on our way
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait

Heaven
(Can wait)
Heaven
(Can wait)
Till another day
(Heaven)
(Can wait)
Till another day
(Heaven)
(Can wait)
Till another day
(Heaven)
(Can wait)
(Heaven)
(Can wait)
Till another day
